            <h1>Hello.</h1>
            <p>I'm Brad.</p>
            <p>I'm a software engineer who excels at finding the simplest way to solve business
                problems using computers.</p>
            <p>With this approach, I've designed and built small and large systems from scratch; from quick proofs of
                concept to fast, stable products that serve millions of users. I've done this leading teams for startups
                and for the biggest consultancies in the world, and a few things in between.</p>

            <p>I'm outgoing, have a wide range of <a href="#about">interests</a>, and communicate well, which enables
                me to connect easily with different types of people across an organisation; this makes me an effective
                teammate and leader.</p>

            <h1>Work</h1>
            <p>I'm currently available for freelance work, which includes <strong>prototyping</strong>, <strong>systems design</strong>,
                <strong>software engineering</strong>, and
                <strong>technical strategy and exposition</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Since I'm very curious and like acquiring new domain knowledge, I am open to
                collaborating on almost any software project. However, I
                have a particular penchant for work that involves <strong>fraud detection</strong>,
                <strong>graph processing</strong>, <strong>event-driven architecture</strong>, <strong>AWS</strong>,
              or the <strong>Go and Python programming languages</strong>.</p>
            <p>I've always aimed to work with companies that have interesting challenges to solve. Here are a
                few that you might recognise:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>At an award-winning startup, I designed, and led a team that built, a <strong>novel graph
                    store</strong> that performed very fast detection of fraud rings in any size of data.
                    This is something that nobody else had been able to do in this field.
                </li>
                <li>I designed, user-tested, and built a <strong>semantic search engine</strong> which uses statistical
                    methods to understand documents rather than use keywords, for one of the world's largest
                    cryptocurrency exchanges.
                </li>
                <li>I built an <strong>arbitrage simulator</strong> for a multi-billion dollar publicly-traded company
                    which used machine learning to find optimal pricing strategies for fast-moving consumer goods across
                    Europe.
                </li>
                <li>I planned and helped orchestrate an <strong>entire web rebrand</strong> for one of the world's
                    largest cryptocurrency exchanges. It went down without a hitch.
                </li>
                <li>I helped pitch for, designed and built, and helped operate a <strong>financial crisis
                    simulator</strong>
                    for one of the world's biggest accounting firms, which was used to help southern African banks
                    prepare to deal with catastrophic world events.

            <p>I've been writing code in one form or another since my family first got internet access (I was
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie">ten years old</a>). I found the
                idea of creating something that could be publicly available online
                intriguing, and wanted to find ways to modify the internet myself.
                What started as a hobby led to a career in programming computers, in which I've learned to deliver
                software
                projects in some of the most demanding industries around.</p>
            <p>I'm South African, and determined to help solve some of the problems my country is facing, particularly
                in reducing unemployment. If you would like to chat
                about any ideas involving the above, please <a href="#contact">contact me</a>.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I mostly spend my time getting better at rock climbing,
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GArRn-cEcaI">skating down hills</a>,
                and <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/isonka">playing music for my friends</a>.

            <p>The best way to get hold of me is by sending an email to <span id="email-address"></span>.</p>
            <p>I sometimes release code on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ny0m">GitHub</a>.</p>
